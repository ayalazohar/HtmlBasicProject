                        The Revuelto is the
                        beginning of a new era for Lamborghini, who has harnessed the power of hybridization technology
                        to create the first HPEV (High Performance Electrified Vehicle). Responding to the need for
                        sustainability and powerful performance, the Lamborghini Revuelto rewrites all paradigms and
                        represents a technical masterpiece beyond anyone’s imagination. The iconic V12 engine finds a
                        new life in this futuristic automotive masterwork that delivers unparalleled performance and
                        driving emotions.</p>

                        From our past, we've
                        learned perfection. This is how the first model of the Lamborghini Huracán was born. More
                        performance, more control, more innovation. The Huracán is equipped with a powerful V10 engine
                        and
                        the latest technologies to perform at its absolute best. Engineered to guarantee the best
                        performance and control under any driving condition, it's easy to take to the limit, not to
                        mention
                        extremely fun, thanks to technology like the Lamborghini Doppia Frizione (LDF) dual clutch
                        gearbox
                        and the electronically-controlled four-wheel drive. Enjoy the best driving experience, ever.

                        Lamborghini Urus is the world’s first Super Sport Utility Vehicle, in which luxury, sportiness and
                        performance
                        meet comfort and versatility. It offers best-in-class driving dynamics, alongside its
                        unmistakable
                        elegance of design. Urus embodies the characteristics of multiple souls: sporty, elegant and
                        off-road, and has a suitability for everyday driving in a range of environments. With its
                        surprisingly distinct engine sound, combined with high performance, Lamborghini Urus is anything
                        but
                        typical.</p>
